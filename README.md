## MarkdownReportsDev is discontinued.

Further development in MarkdownReports. See: #4.
MarkdownReportsDev was made when big changes were happening. The development reached its goals. Further development will be in MarkdownReports.


## News

### Version 4.1.0 is ready and installed by the default. 

1. See legacy/old version at: https://github.com/vertesy/MarkdownReports.v2.9.5
2. See development version at: https://github.com/vertesy/MarkdownReportsDev


### New features:

- **Formatted session info Sessioninfo**
- Updated dependencies
- Many functions are more stable and versatile



**Old version** is under `MarkdownReports.LEGACY.VERSION.X.X.X`.



## What is ***MarkdownReports***?


MarkdownReports is a set of **R** functions that allows you to generate precise figures easily, and create clean reports in markdown language about what you just discovered with your analysis script. It helps you to:


1. Create scientifically accurate figures and save them automatically as vector graphic (.pdf), that you can use from presentation to posters anywhere.
2. Note down your findings easily in a clear and nicely formatted way, parsed from your variables into english sentences.
- Link & display your figures automatically inside your report, right there where they are needed.
- Version your findings, annotating which parameters were used to reach certain results.
- Share your report with others via email, Github or a personal website.


## Why did I make it & why you might like it too?

I do exploratory data analysis as a daily routine, and I have constant interaction with all sorts of people: supervisors, collaborators, colleagues, etc. 

I often have to...

1. Make figures quickly.
2. ...write emails summarising the results (text & figures) of the last few days.
3. ...find results from a couple of month back, with all tiny details (parameters used, etc).
4. ...assemble each step I did that day into a logical story line, that others can understand at first glimpse, e.g.: *I observed X; I controlled for Y; Hypothesised explanation A; Falsified it; Came up with explanation B; Tested & proven it...*

For all of the above, my solution is MarkdownReports. I think its better than other solutions I found. Many of those like to combine source code with results, and many are too complex to use. Most of people I interact with are not interested in  the source code, but are very keen on seeing my results from all possible angles and are asking detailed questions about the analysis.

## Make figures quickly

- The philosophy of the package is to ***type little*** (but draw and save correctly annotated figures).
- Instead of specifying everything in lengthy commands (*ala ggplot*), plotting functions make use of sensible defaults (such as meaningful variable name, row names, column names, etc.)
- Both display and save each plot as `.pdf` dynamically named (from variable names)
- Examples: `wboxplot()` takes a list, used the `variable name` to set the *filename* and the *title*,  `list element names` to set the *x-axis labels*, saves the file as `variable name.pdf` (or `.png`).
- All plot functions start with **w**, followed by the **base plot name**, such as `wplot()`,  `wbarplot()`, `wpie()`, `wboxplot()`,but also `wvenn()`, `wvioplot_list()`,`wviostripchart_list()`.

## Write a report on the fly

### Differences to Rmarkdown:


- It is intended for a **different purpose**: 
  - **MarkdownReports** is written for **rapid progress reporting**, whereas
  - **Rmarkdown** is perfect for writing **analytical explanations** on "*how do you analyse this?*" and writing longer books.
- **Much faster to report in MarkdownReports:** 
  - You **parse your report on the fly** from **directly your working script**. (
  - *In Rmarkdown you would make a separate cleaned-up a script, that you then knit as a separate step.*
- **No hassle of** executing computation in **isolated code-blocks** (and importing all relevant variables there). *Your code is also a lot easier to follow because it is not split up in blocks.*

### Where does ***MarkdownReports*** stand out?

- **Pure markdown output**, compatible, simple and elegant layout.
- Integration of text, figures and tables with ***very* few lines of extra code.**
- Easy generation of **precise figures** (axis labels, coloring by filtering etc), a big enhancement over base graphics, while maintaining 90% of its syntax.
- **Plots are both displayed and saved as a vector graphic** (pdf), making it scalable for presentations, posters, etc
- **Traceable results**:
  - **PDF plots are labeled by the script generating them** in the title field: `Filter.and.Stats by ExpressionAnalysis.R`
  - The **report** file is automatically **named after the R-script, and date** so that it is linked to the source code that generated it.
  - Simply **log all used settings** into a markdown table by the `log_settings_MarkDown()` and the ` md.LogSettingsFromList()`functions.
- it **natively exports tables** from R to Markdown
- A timestamped subdirectory is created that you can backup once satisfied with your results.
- **Github Compatibility:**The generated report is easy to [share on a GitHub wiki](https://github.com/vertesy/MarkdownReports/wiki/Github-wiki-integration). 
- It **parses and writes full sentences** to the report from operations you perform.  
  - For instance filter on gene expression level: 
```R
GeneExpression = rnorm(2000, mean = 100, sd=50); 
MinExpression=125
PASS=filter_HP(GeneExpression, threshold = MinExpression)
```
and your report will have the summary: ***30.7 % or 614 of 2000 entries in GeneExpression fall above a threshold value of: 125.***

- **Enhanced productivity** features:
  - **Error bars** are handled by `wbarplot()` natively.
  - Add an labels to bars in a barplot by `barplot_label()`. 
  - Native **2-D error bars** in scatterplots`wplot()` .
  - Easy **colour schemes** by `wcolorize()` from  `base`, `gplots` and `Rcolorbrewer`.
  - Add **legends** with the super short command `wlegend(colannot$categ)`, defining colors named after the categories of your data. 
    - It is autmatically created by `colannot = wcolorize(your.annotation, ReturnCategoriesToo = T)`, which you (can) anyways use to colour data points on, say, your scatterplot.
  - **Show filtering results with a one liner**: `whist(rnorm(1000), vline = .5, filtercol = T)`.
- *Although **currently** plotting is implemented as an enhanced **base graphic**, but the concept could easily be extended to **ggplot**.*  
  Yet, you can still use ggplot, because you equally well save and report them by either `wplot_save_this()` or the `pdfA4plot_on()` and `pdfA4plot_off()` functions.
- It is all achieved in ~ 1600 lines of well documented code compiled into a proper R-package.

## Installation

Install directly from **GitHub** via **devtools** with one R command:

    # install.packages("devtools"); # If you don't have it
    require("devtools")
    devtools::install_github(repo = "vertesy/MarkdownReportsDev")

...then simply load the package:

    require("MarkdownReports")

Alternatively, you simply source it from the web. 
*This way function help will not work, and you will have no local copy of the code on your hard drive.*

    source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vertesy/MarkdownReportsDev/master/R/MarkdownReportsDev.R")

## Older News

[3.1.1  is under legacy now]

### Version 3.1.1 is ready and installed by the default. 

1. See legacy/old version at: https://github.com/vertesy/MarkdownReports.v2.9.5
2. See development version at: https://github.com/vertesy/MarkdownReportsDev


### New features"

- **Function argument names now mirror the `R base` argument names (99%).**

  - Think of `xlb >>> xlab`, or  `sub_ >>> sub`
- This however breaks the compatibility with earlier versions, so you might need to replace some function arguments
- **The package now can also work with png images.**

  - You can save files in png, which can be displayed inside the markdown file on windows 7.

  - You need to set `b.usepng=T` in `setup_MarkdownReports`: `setup_MarkdownReports(OutDir = "/Users/...blabla....", b.usepng=T)`
- The package contains multiple other bug fixes:

  - Self consistency: some missing functions moved from `CodeAndRoll.R` 
  - Table writing functions `md.tableWriter.DF.w.dimnames()` and `md.tableWriter.VEC.w.names()`
- Enhancements: 

  - `filter_HP(), filter_LP(), filter_MidPass()` show histogram
  - `whist()` can invite the above filter functions.
- Numerous other small fixes.



**Old version** is under `MarkdownReports.LEGACY.VERSION`.
